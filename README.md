Hey! I'm @gorbulus (Will Ponton) ðŸ‘‹
Pronouns: he/him/his ðŸ˜„

I'm a software developer from Dallas, Texas. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19881320/120910613-49a17980-c64e-11eb-8d77-212195b9714c.png)

I currently live in Jacksonville, Florida. ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

I'm passionate about guitars, data, Python, and my dogs.

âš¡ I'm working as a Product Manager and created one of the largest PIMs in the world.

I use my talents to connect the dots using an analytical approach to data. ðŸŒŽ

I follow the 'Jobs to be done' Product management philosophy - customers 'hire' your poduct to satisfy a job.

ðŸ”­ I like to build things with Python, R, SQL/NoSQL, Django, and C#/.Net. ðŸ¤–

ðŸŒ± I'm currently dedicating a high percentage of my time to learning Django, playing with datasets, and improving my UI skills.  I labsolutely love diagramming and wireframe creation.

ðŸ‘¯ I'd like to get more experience contributing to open-souce projects and some hand-on work with APIs.
