Hey! I'm @gorbulus (Will Ponton) 👋
Pronouns: he/him/his 😄

I'm a software developer from Dallas, Texas. 🐮

I currently live in Jacksonville, Florida. 🌴

I'm passionate about guitars, data, Python, and my dogs. 🎸

I'm working as a Product Manager and implemented one of the largest PIMs in the world. ⚡

I use my talents to connect the dots using an analytical approach to data. 🌎

I follow the 'Jobs to be done' Product management philosophy - customers 'hire' your poduct to satisfy job steps. 👷

I like to build things with Python, R, SQL/NoSQL, Django, and C#/.Net. 🤖

I'm currently dedicating a high percentage of my time to learning Django, playing with datasets, and improving my UI skills.  I labsolutely love diagramming and wireframe creation. 🌱

I'd like to get more experience contributing to open-souce projects and some hand-on work with APIs.👯
